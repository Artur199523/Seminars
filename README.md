# 📚 Seminar Management Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 🚀 Overview

The Seminar Management Application is a React-based web application designed for managing and organizing seminars
efficiently. It incorporates reusable components and hooks, as well as a centralized state management system using Redux
Toolkit. The application is built using modern web development tools and practices, ensuring optimal performance and
maintainability.

## ✨ Features

🧩 Reusable Components: Modular components such as Textarea, modals like UpdateSeminarModal, and context providers (ModalProvider) make the application extensible and scalable.\
🎛️ State Management: Centralized application state using Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for state synchronization with backend APIs.\
🖊️ Form Enhancements: Custom hooks such as useModalContext and utility services streamline processes and interactions.\
⚙️ Codebase Organization: A clean folder structure with organized types, utilities, and API layers.
